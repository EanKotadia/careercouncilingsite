# Career Counseling Website Mockup
This is a non-functional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript mockup I created in grade 8 to showcase my design skills and passion for web development. The website was designed to help students navigate their path to top colleges, including Ivy League schools, by providing resources and guidance.

## About the Project

I built this project as a way to explore web design and practice creating responsive and visually appealing layouts. Though it’s just a mockup, the goal of the site was to:

Offer tools for career exploration and planning.
Provide resources for college applications and standardized tests.
Inspire students to aim for their dream universities.
Features (Theoretical)

College Recommendations: A tailored list of colleges based on interests and achievements.
Career Guides: Step-by-step guidance on various career paths.
Resources Hub: Access to mock tests, essay tips, and application advice.
## Personal Note

This project is close to my heart because it reflects my journey in learning web development and my desire to create meaningful tools for students. It’s a snapshot of my skills and aspirations as a student developer.

## Technologies Used

HTML for the structure.
CSS for styling and layout.
JavaScript for interactive elements (non-functional in this mockup).
